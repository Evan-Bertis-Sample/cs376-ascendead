# Starting node
Hi, my name is Bones.

I'm a shopkeeper! Buy things from me, if you dare!

# First simple branch example
[Branch]
[Option("What's up?")]
Nothing much!
[Exit]

[Option("My name is Skelly")]
Nice to meet you Skelly!
[Exit]

# On exit, continues to main stream
Anyway, I've heard of some scary things happening around here.


# Nested Branching example
[Branch("ASK ME")]
[Option("What kind of things?")]
Lots. There are souls and creeps wandering everywhere.

[Branch]
[Option("Tell me about the souls")]
Yeah so the souls are looking for a way out of this place but can't find it.
I heard that they are stuck here because they haven't felt inner peace.
# exits back to ask me branch
[Exit("ASK ME")]

[Option("Tell me about the creeps)]
They are just wierd...

That's all I really have to say about them.
[Exit("ASK ME)]

[Option("Oh nevermind")]
Okay...
# Back to linear branch
[Exit]

Well, it was nice to meet you. Hope to see you again some time!
