Oh...

It's been a while since I've seen one of you.

# First simple branch example
[Branch]
[Option("One of me?")]
Yeah, a skelly like me that can walk around, like me self.
I was beginning to think that I was destined to an eternity alone...
[Exit]

[Option("Who are you?")]
I think the better question is who are you?
I thought i was the only skelly around.
[Exit]

The name is Skeeps, by the way.

Don't be frightened, but you are in the underworld.

[Branch]
[Option("The underworld?")]
Yes. The underworld.
[Exit]

Right now, we have an abundance of souls that have been let loose.
They have just been flying around everywhere.
I've been collecting them, in hopes that I can return them back to where they belong.
They seem to really be concentrated in the upper bits of the underworld.
But, I have a lot of luggage to carry around in this coffin.
Could you help me?

[Branch]
[Option("I guess I have no other choice...")]
Splendid!
I think this would help you.
*Gives you a strange orange orb*

[Event("UpgradeCharge", 5)]

That is a little piece of a fractured soul.
These fractured souls seem to give us Skellys some abilities.
With it, you should be able to jump higher.
That should help you ascend the rocky terrain and get those souls for me!
Try it out!
