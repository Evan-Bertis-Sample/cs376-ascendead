## Credits
All art, programming, sound effects and design made by Evan Bertis-Sample, with the exception of the Unity Game Engine.

The game was created using [Curly](https://github.com/Evan-Bertis-Sample/Curly), a Unity framework under development by Evan. The parts of the framework using DoTween were unused for the project, but are still included because this was built using the template.

The music was created by Daniel Franco, a friend of Evan, originally for [Vincentius](https://evanmakesstuff.itch.io/vincentius), with permission for use in Ascendead.

Artwork was created using Aesprite, and sound effects created using BFXR.
